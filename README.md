# Tom Tostanoski

## Who the heck are you?

I'm Tom. I live in Columbus, Ohio, USA with my ladyfriend. I like video games, comics, lots of different music, vinyl records, weird TV and movies, professional wrestling, pub quiz, and sleep. Particularly sleep.

## Why should I care?

To be honest, you probably shouldn't. But if you want to, it's because I might be the technical support rockstar that you're looking for. Or because I'm a quizmaster for [Geeks Who Drink](https://geekswhodrink.com). Presently I'm subbing in the Columbus area, but I'll likely have a permanent venue should any come online.

You might also be interested because of my goatee, lip piercing, bald head, or because I started a sentence with a conjunction above. ~~Fight me, grammar nerds!~~ Actually please don't, as you're probably win and I don't have the energy.

Since originally writing this I've transitioned away from technical support to the related areas of technical support and webmastery. I maintain the the [Veeva Vault Help project](https://veevavault.help) at [Veeva](https://veeva.com).

## Anything else we should know?

I dunno. I'm not much of a developer, but I've been known to write code every now and then. I can hack a little Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (I really don't like JavaScript), Objective-C and Swift. I speak English as my primary language. I took Spanish in school and still remember a good bit of it. In 2018 I learned some Portuguese to try to keep up with my Brazilian coworkers. I no longer work for the Brazilians, and I'm damn glad.

I'll update my gear list eventually. I've had three laptops in two years due to role and platform changes, so it's hard to pin things down. Right now, I'm writing this on a MacBook Pro M1 Max.

I have a tattoo of Tux the Linux mascot on my right shoulder. Get to know me and I might let you see it.

## How do I get in touch with you?

That's a bit up in the air right now. I still hate email, and Twitter has become, well, whatever the hell Twitter is now. I guess for now seek out @tommytoastnose on Instagram. Wait, that's a private account now. Ugh, I hate modern communication. Fine, <tom@nerdnest.net>. Happy now?

I also added a discussion forum to the page. Feel free to ask me questions there.
