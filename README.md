# Tom Tostanoski

## Who the heck are you?

I'm Tom. I live in Columbus, Ohio, USA with my ladyfriend. I like video games, comics, lots of different music, vinyl records, weird TV and movies, professional wrestling, pub quiz, and sleep. Particularly sleep.

## Why should I care?

To be honest, you probably shouldn't. But if you want to, it's because I might be the technical support rockstar that you're looking for. Or because I'm a quizmaster for [Geeks Who Drink](https://geekswhodrink.com). Presently I'm subbing in the Columbus area, but I'll likely have a permanent venue should any come online.

You might also be interested because of my goatee, lip piercing, bald head, or because I started a sentence with a conjunction above. ~~Fight me, grammar nerds!~~ Actually please don't, as you're probably win and I don't have the energy.

Since originally writing this I've transitioned away from technical support to the related areas of technical support and webmastery. I maintain the the [Veeva Vault Help project](https://veevavault.help) at [Veeva](https://veeva.com).

## Anything else we should know?

I dunno. I'm not much of a developer, but I've been known to write code every now and then. I can hack a little Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (I really don't like JavaScript), Objective-C and Swift. I speak English as my primary language. I took Spanish in school and still remember a good bit of it. In 2018 I learned some Portuguese to try to keep up with my Brazilian coworkers. I no longer work for the Brazilians, and I'm damn glad.

I'll update my gear list eventually. I've had three laptops in two years due to role and platform changes, so it's hard to pin things down. Right now, I'm writing this on a MacBook Pro M1 Max.

I have a tattoo of Tux the Linux mascot on my right shoulder. Get to know me and I might let you see it.

## What's going on right now?

Musically, I'm on a [Chicago](https://www.chicagotheband.com) kick. They're an incredibly interesting band with a strange, tumultuous history. A lot of people know the songs from the 1980s during the Peter Cetera-as-leader era with a lot of ballads, but the best stuff all comes before Terry Kath accidentally shot himself cleaning a gun while intoxicated.

Wow, that got real dark real fast. Sorry about that.

Kath was an amazing guitar player with a baritone voice to match. While he was alive the band was mostly a democracy. You hear a lot more horns on the tracks, and his guitar playing is fire. Multiple band members report that Jimi Hendrix himself told them "The horns are like one set of lungs, and your guitar player is better than me."

The quintessential track from the early days is probably "25 or 6 to 4." Rolling Stone shared a [great video](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-chicago-play-a-smoldering-25-or-6-to-4-in-1970-20160412) of them playing it back in 1970. It's a banger, as the kids would say.

On the video game front I'm working on *Metroid: Samus Returns* on 3DS. One of the first Game Boy games I had as a kid was *Metroid 2: The Return of Samus*, and this is a wonderful throwback to that weird little sequel.

I'll update this section as what I'm consuming changes. It's an interesting window into my life.

## How do I get in touch with you?

That's a bit up in the air right now. I still hate email, and Twitter has become, well, whatever the hell Twitter is now. I guess for now seek out @tommytoastnose on Instagram. Wait, that's a private account now. Ugh, I hate modern communication. Fine, <tom@nerdnest.net>. Happy now?
