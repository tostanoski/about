# Tom Tostanoski

## Who the heck are you?

I'm Tom. I live in The Bronx, NY, USA in a converted living room within an apartment. I like video games, comics, lots of different music, vinyl records, weird TV and movies, professional wrestling, pub quiz, and sleep. Particularly sleep.

## Why should I care?

To be honest, you probably shouldn't. But if you want to, it's because I run the support team over at [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat). Or because I'm a quizmaster for [Geeks Who Drink](https://geekswhodrink.com). I currently host at [The Park View](http://www.theparkviewcafe.com) and occasionally you'll catch me subbing at other New York City venues.

You might also be interested because of my groovy blue hair (Manic Panic Rockabilly Blue, if you're curious), or because I started two sentences with conjunctions above. ~~Fight me, grammar nerds!~~ Actually please don't, as you're probably win and I don't have the energy.

## Anything else we should know?

I dunno. I'm not much of a developer, but I've been known to write code every now and then. I can hack a little Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (I really don't like JavaScript), Objective-C and Swift. I speak English as my primary language. I took Spanish in school and still remember a good bit of it. I'm learning Portuguese to try to keep up with my Brazilian coworkers.

There's really one one *l* in Brazilian? Wild.

I use a MacBook Pro to get my work done, an iPhone 6s for most of my communication, and a sweet Windows 10 PC in the Mini-ITX formfactor for gaming. I also have a pile of other consoles and handhelds, so if it's a video game, I probably have something to play it on.

I have a tattoo of Tux the Linux mascot on my right shoulder. Get to know me and I might let you see it.

## What's going on right now?

Musically, I'm on a [Chicago](https://www.chicagotheband.com) kick. They're an incredibly interesting band with a strange, tumultuous history. A lot of people know the songs from the 1980s during the Peter Cetera-as-leader era with a lot of ballads, but the best stuff all comes before Terry Kath accidentally shot himself cleaning a gun while intoxicated.

Wow, that got real dark real fast. Sorry about that.

Kath was an amazing guitar player with a baritone voice to match. While he was alive the band was mostly a democracy. You hear a lot more horns on the tracks, and his guitar playing is fire. Multiple band members report that Jimi Hendrix himself told them "The horns are like one set of lungs, and your guitar player is better than me."

The quintessential track from the early days is probably "25 or 6 to 4." Rolling Stone shared a [great video](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-chicago-play-a-smoldering-25-or-6-to-4-in-1970-20160412) of them playing it back in 1970. It's a banger, as the kids would say.

On the video game front I'm working on *Metroid: Samus Returns* on 3DS. One of the first Game Boy games I had as a kid was *Metroid 2: The Return of Samus*, and this is a wonderful throwback to that weird little sequel.

I need to finish *The Handmaid's Tale* on Hulu. I promised my ladyfriend I would.

I'll update this section as what I'm consuming changes. It's an interesting window into my life.

## How do I get in touch with you?

I'm an introvert and it's often awkward meeting new people. If you're up for the challenge, you can find me on Twitter. I'm [@toastnose](https://twitter.com/toastnose), where I have a potty mouth and don't talk about work stuff. From the looks of it, I spend a lot of time retweeting pro wrestler Hermit Crab.

There's probably some way to interact with me here as well. If you do so I'll do my best to look for it.
